# weatherApp

This is a weather application that I coded in Python. It uses the OpenWeather API to retrieve current weather data. After the user inputs a
city, the weather is displayed with an emoji. This program introduced me to PyQt5 and APIs. My goal going forward with this
project is to expand it to a 7-day forecast. It would also be fun to precip maps.
